  <h1>How To Fix BSOD Due To CrowdStrike Issue</h1>

  <h2>What Caused the Blue Screen Of Death Error</h2>
  <p>The Blue Screen of Death errors were triggered by a recent update to CrowdStrike’s Falcon sensor, a component of their endpoint security software. Many users on Reddit shared that the issue appears to be related to the “DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER” error, which prevents your system from starting up normally and operating.</p>

  <h2>How To Fix BSOD CrowdStrike Error</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment</li>
    <li>Turn off the device by holding the power button for 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>Then, turn on the device and as soon as Windows starts (e.g., the manufacturer’s logo appears), immediately again turn off the device.</li>
    <li>Repeat this until a full restart takes place and (enters Windows Recovery Environment)</li>
    <li>In the Recovery Environment, navigate to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart.</li>
    <li>From the list of options, select Option 5 or press F5 for “Safe Mode with Networking.”</li>
    <li>Once booted into safe mode – navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory</li>
    <li>Locate the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, and delete it.</li>
    <li>Boot the host normally.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note: If your device’s BitLocker is preventing you from booting into safe mode, you can get your BitLocker recovery key from your Microsoft or Azure AD-linked account.</p>

  <h2>CrowdStrike’s Response to BSOD Error</h2>
  <p>Engineering teams at CrowdStrike are actively working to resolve the issue, with the company advising users not to open individual support tickets.
